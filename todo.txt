player interactions:
DONE
- have two players on the screen 
- make sure they're seperate instances
DOING
- have them be able to shoot each other
- slash deflects bullets
- respawers
- i frames on slide
- picking up more ammo
- 




feel based stuff:
- have gun kb be slighly based on the x dir too
- have an input buffer 
- variable jump height
- jump speed carries into slide
- slide just reduces your friction until you stop?
